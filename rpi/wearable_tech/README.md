wearable workshop
=================
These are the PDFs and code for the wearable workshop I ran for Girl Guides back in March.
Please feel free to download, fork and borrow these resources: a bit of credit would be nice but I'm not expecting anything else.

Setup
*****
The resources and code are currently intended for use with the following hardware:
- 1 GEMMA (adafruit)
- 2 RGB neopixels (adafruit)
- 1 battery (with a 2 pin male JST connector: advisory on what voltage is best for GEMMA will be on the Adafruit website)
- 1 laptop+micro usb cable
(per person/per pair)

The code can be imported/copied into Arduino: I'll add more instructions to doing this if you're not sure where to put it
later on.

Running order
*************
In the actual workshop, the order of PDFs goes as:
intro -> components -> reprogramming -> sewing

Please give me a shout if anything's not right or confusing.

Thanks!
Charlotte
